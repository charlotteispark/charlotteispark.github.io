    - title: Visiting Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA
      year: 2020-2021
      description:
        - title: Summer 2021
          contents:
            - Optimized ray tracing engine in C while generating reproducible results.
            - Parallelized code using OpenCilk and obtained profiling results on machines
with up to 8 cores.
            - Performed work-span analysis to analyze potential for parallelism. Optimized
both serial and parallel code to obtain runtimes up to 75 times as fast as original code.
        - title: Summer 2020
          contents:
            - Worked on optimization of child filtering in spatial partition trees using uncompressed and compressed tries.
            - Examined various algorithmic techniques for constructing theoretically optimal tries.
            - Developed and implemented heuristic algorithm for reordering trie codes in C.
