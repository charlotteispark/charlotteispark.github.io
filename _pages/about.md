Hi, I'm Charlotte! I am currently a first year EECS PhD student at MIT, affiliated with the [Labaratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/) (MIT LIDS). I am advised by [Devavrat Shah](https://devavrat.mit.edu/). My research interests lie in causal inference, algorithms, and more broadly in both theoretical computer science and ML theory.

Prior to starting at MIT, a received my bachelors from Caltech in Computer Science. During my time at Caltech, I worked with [Leonard Schulman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~schulman/) in the [Theory of Computation](http://theory.cms.caltech.edu/) group, working on causal identification algorithms within the Do-Calculus framework. During two of my undergraduate summers, I worked in the [Supertech](https://supertech.mit.edu/) group at MIT with [Charles Leiserson](https://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/).

My research is supported by an MIT Presidential Fellowship.
